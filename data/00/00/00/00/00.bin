这是一种合成气体

他在世界各地都安插了寡妇

你要去告诉她们 一切都结束了
You should be the one to tell 'em it's over.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,370
2018年

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,830
你好 安娜
Hi there, Ana.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,000

别动 我是来帮助你的

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,040
那为什么要闯进我家
Then why'd you break into my house?

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,830
- 什么  - 索尼娅 按住她的手
- What? - Sonya, hold her hands.

12
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,540
给她注射解毒剂
Hurry. Hit her with the antidote.

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,120
好的
Okay.

14
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,080
接下来会有点难受 不过我们是来帮助你的
The next bit is gonna be really scary, but we're here to help you.

15
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,120
看看你们把我的地毯弄的
Look what you did to my rug.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,410
两万美元的地毯就这么糟蹋了 真是谢谢你们
Twenty thousand dollars down the drain. Thanks.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,700
你说什么 
Excuse me?

18
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,410
我觉得她没有被洗脑
I don't think she was brainwashed.

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,910
什么 你以为我是被那些 有钱的变态包养的 
What? You thought I was some rich pervert's prisoner?

20
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,950
算是吧
Well, yeah, kind of.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,950
等等 这是你自己家 你哪来这么多钱 
Wait, this is your house? How can you afford all of this?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,040
做咱们最擅长的事 当杀手呗
By doing the thing we're all best at. Killing for money.

23
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,500
那么你们救了多少寡妇了 
So, how many widows have you helped?

24
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,160
很多
Many. Many.

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,450
挺不容易的
Yeah, it's hard work.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,200
找到她们很不容易
It's hard finding them. It's...

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,200
看着她们觉醒过来也不容易
It's hard watching them wake.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
但是这一切是值得的
But it's so worth it.

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,450
解决了这些烂摊子以后
And when we've cleared up all of this mess,

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,040
我们就要去过自己的生活了
we will make good lives for ourselves.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,580
叶莲娜 你姐姐怎么样 
Yelena, how is your sister doing?

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,370
她挺好的
She's doing okay.

33
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,950
- 那就好 - 她挺好的
- Good. - Yeah, she's good.

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,290
然后你就会和娜塔莎团聚
And then, you and Natasha will be reunited

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,580
在纽约过《欲望都市》那样的好日子
and go live your Sex and the City fantasy in New York.

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,750
我失陪一下
Excuse me.

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,790
咱们一块看《欲望都市》吧
Sex and the City, we should watch it together.

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,830
怎么回事 发生了什么 
What's happening? What's going on?

39
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,450
- 你是谁  - 你又是谁 
- Uh, who are you? - Who are you?

40
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,120
叶莲娜 天啊 你回来了
Yelena? Oh, my God, you're back.

41
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,950
她是谁啊 妈妈 
Who's that, Mommy?

42
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,080
没事的 孩子 她是个老朋友
It's okay, sweetie. She's an old friend.

43
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,040
五年后

44
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,700
我结婚了
I got married.

45
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,160
三年前我们领养了孩子 非常幸福
We adopted three years ago, it's been amazing.

46
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,040
索尼娅后来也走了
Sonya, who left my house

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,450
她离开的方式 可没有你那天那么神奇
in a much less dramatic fashion than you did that day,

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,580
她明白了这一切 你也会明白的
realized this and now you will too.

49
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,410
你先去找个工作
You can start with contract work.

50
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,580
然后你在这住多久都可以
And then you can stay here as long as you need.

51
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,750
好吧 等等
Okay, stop.

52
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,000
安娜 我进去了才五秒钟
Ana, I was in there for five seconds,

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,000
出来以后就失去了五年的时间 天啊
I come out and I've lost five years of my life. Please.

54
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,750
抱歉 叶莲娜 我只是想帮助你
I'm sorry, Yelena. I was just trying to help you.

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,500
我知道…谢谢

56
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,120
我得去找娜塔莎
I need to find Natasha.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
你能帮我找到娜塔莎吗  我得告诉她我没事
Can you help me find Natasha? I need to tell her I'm okay.

58
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,370
我不能失去凯特
I cannot lose Kate.

59
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,620
我以前也失去过亲人
I've lost people before.

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
我知道你也有过类似的经历
I know in your line of work, you have, too.

61
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,080
我明白
I understand.

62
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,200
前情提要

63
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,160
斯隆是个空壳公司 专门给运动服黑手党洗钱
Sloan's a shell company that launders money for the Tracksuits.

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,450
杰克·杜凯恩是公司的CEO
And Jack Duquesne is the CEO.

65
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,290
- 你在烁灭中失去了家人吗  - 是的
- You lost your family in the Blip? - Yeah.

66
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,830
你就是那时遇到浪人的吗  浪人就是你 对吗 
Is that where you met the Ronin? It's you, isn't it?

67
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,870
每个人都有自己应对烁灭的方式
Everybody dealt with the Blip in their own way.

68
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,830
你想要什么 
What do you want?

69
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,330
我不想闹出任何人命
I don't want anybody else to die.

70
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,910
但是玛雅的复仇心态会让她送命
But Maya's need for vengeance is gonna get her killed.

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,750
有人雇佣了黑寡妇来当刺客
Someone has hired a Black Widow assassin.

72
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,910
情况很严重 很紧急 我得自己行动了
This has gotten very real, very quickly. So I'm doing this alone.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
我是自愿来的
I chose to be here.

74
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,950
我知道有风险 我都知道
I understand the risk, I understand all of that.

75
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,370
我不能这么做
I'm not gonna do it.

76
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,790
回家吧 凯特 结束了
Go home, Kate. It's over.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,790
《鹰眼》
第一季第五集

78
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,120
凯特 
Kate?

79
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,950
天啊
Oh, my God.

80
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,540
你还好吗 
Are you okay?

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,410
你为什么穿着射箭服 
And why are you wearing your archery suit?

82
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,870
我没事
I'm okay.

83
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,410
和克林特·巴顿有关系吗 
Does this have to do with Clint Barton?

84
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,000
不 妈妈 克林特保护了我
Mom, no. Clint protected me.

85
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,700
你肯定很高兴 他让我回家去
You'll be glad to know he then told me to come home

86
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,160
和他保持距离
and stay away from him.

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,950
看着我
Look at me.

88
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,450
我只在乎你一个
You're the only thing that matters to me.

89
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,370
你确定没事吗 
Are you sure you're okay?

90
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,250
过来
Oh. Come here. Come here.

91
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,120
我的宝贝女儿
Oh. My baby girl.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,620
没事的 亲爱的
It's okay, hon.

93
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,910
克林特觉得你是超级英雄吗 
Does Clint think you're a superhero?

94
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,200
不是
No.

95
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,290
我也一样
I don't either.

96
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,200
我知道你现在很害怕 凯特
I know it's scary now, Kate.

97
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,250
但是这不会改变你自己
But this doesn't have to change who you are.

98
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,410
只是你做的事情
It just means that what you do

99
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,290
和你的童年梦想 会有那么点小小的差别
might look a little different than you dreamed of as a child.

100
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,080
当然 能不那么鲁莽就更好了
And preferably a little less reckless.

101
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,450
我从来没想要鲁莽 我只是想帮助你
I never wanted to be reckless. I wanted to help you.

102
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,830
我知道 亲爱的
I know, hon.

103
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,580
鲁莽也不都是你的错
Recklessness is the unfortunate side effect.

104
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,830
你肯定很后悔给我买第一把弓吧 是不是 
Bet you regret buying me that first bow, don't you?

105
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,950
有时候会吧
Sometimes.

106
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,870
开玩笑的
Kidding.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,700
你拿着那把小弓的样子太可爱了
You were so cute with that tiny bow.

108
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,290
天啊 我真以为自己无所不能
God, I thought I could do anything.

109
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,330
我真的觉得可以成为他们之一
I really thought I could be one of them.

110
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,000
别泄气 亲爱的
Don't beat yourself up, hon.

111
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,950
有的时候我们要走的路
Sometimes the paths we're on,

112
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,200
可能比预期的更加曲折
they wind around in ways that we never would have expected.

113
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,830
你能做的就只有不断前进
All you can do is keep moving forward,

114
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,620
即便有时候你会觉得一切都糟透了
even on days when honestly, it all just kind of feels like shit.

115
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,910
你担心过我迷失方向吗 
Do you ever worry about me not finding my path?

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,830
从来没有
No.

117
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,500
我了解你
I know exactly who you are.

118
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,580
我都能想象出你未来的样子
And I have a pretty good picture of who you're becoming.

119
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,250
我得告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something.

120
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,330
克林特和我在调查阿曼德的谋杀案
Clint and I have been looking into Armand's murder.

121
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,410
我们发现了很多杰克的犯罪证据 妈妈
And we found a lot of incriminating stuff about Jack, Mom.

122
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,120
包括他名下的这个空壳公司 斯隆有限公司
Including this Shell company that he has, called Sloan Limited.

123
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,620
也许背后有其它原因
Maybe there's a reason for all...

124
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,500
我也不确定 但是你一定要向我保证
I don't know. But you have to please just promise me

125
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,750
你一定要去查一下 我没别的要求
that you'll look into it. That's all I ask.

126
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,870
好的 我会的
Okay. Okay, I will.

127
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,410
拿上你的东西回家去吧
You go get your things and come back home.

128
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,700
嘿
Hey.

129
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,000
在我面前你不用假装没事

130
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,410
来吧
Come on.

131
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,160
很疼

132
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,790
我不掩饰了

133
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,250
这就是我的感受

134
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,540
今天晚上还有另一个人

135
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,500
一个女人

136
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,830
身手不凡 她…

137
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,500
她是和他们一伙的

138
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,450
不是 我觉得他们不认识她

139
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,120
事情有些不对劲

140
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,080
可能比我想的还要严重

141
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,330
你的追杀…

142
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,500
必须收手
Must stop.

143
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,370
现在

144
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,750
我都这么接近目标了

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,370
我会帮你抓住浪人

146
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,000
但是…

147
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,620
咱们杀了他以后

148
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,080
就到此为止

149
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,120
好吗 
Okay?

150
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,330
天啊
Oh, my God.

151
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,910
凯特·毕晓普
Kate Bishop.

152
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,540
你好
Hi.

153
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,660
我做了通心粉 你要不要来点
I made macaroni if you want some.

154
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,200
不好意思 你说什么 
I'm sorry. What?

155
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,620
我快饿死了 你又一直不回来
Well, I was starving and you took forever.

156
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,660
所以我就想先做点东西吃
So I wanted to make food.

157
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,700
你想要干什么 
What do you want?

158
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,290
别紧张 凯特·毕晓普 我就是想和你谈谈 好吗 
Relax, Kate Bishop. I just want to talk, okay?

159
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,370
你真的不饿吗 
Are you really not hungry?

160
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,910
打了那么久
That fight was so long.

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,870
真的挺好吃的 真的不错
It's really tasty. Really tasty.

162
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,120
我知道盒装奶酪通心粉是什么味道
I know what boxed mac and cheese tastes like.

163
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,580
我知道…确实挺好吃的
I know it's... It's delicious.

164
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,330
我需要叉子
Forks. Forks.

165
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,580
不会吧
No.

166
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,910
你只有一把叉子 
You have one fork?

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,330
- 我是一个人住 - 太奇怪了
- I'm one person. - That's so weird.

168
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,750
凯特 这根本不是吃饭用的
Kate, this is not cutlery. This is not cutlery.

169
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,620
我不会和你一起吃饭的
I am not gonna have dinner with you

170
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,120
你刚才想要杀了我 然后现在又闯进我的家
after you tried to kill me and then broke into my house.

171
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,500
我可没想杀了你
I did not try to kill you.

172
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,750
首先 我把你挂在电线上 是为了让你别碍事
A, I put you on a wire to remove an obstacle.

173
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,950
其次 我也没闯进来
And B, I did not break anything.

174
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,620
我的手法可比你想的细致多了
I am way too talented than that.

175
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,000
最后 放下戒心 好吗 
And C, stop being so defensive. Okay?

176
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,330
你太充满敌意了
You're so hostile.

177
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,200
我不会伤害你的 我保证
I'm not going to hurt you. I promise.

178
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,750
我也没拿任何武器
I don't have any weapons on me.

179
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,160
好吧 这句话我收回
Okay, I take that back.

180
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,660
现在我的手里没拿任何武器
I don't have any weapons currently in my hands.

181
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,200
这也是骗人
That's a lie also.

182
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,250
来吧 拿个叉子 一起吃吧
Come on, take a fork. Eat. Eat.

183
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,330
拜托了 我爸爸说 好好吃饭才能有好身体
Please, my daddy says it's good for you.

184
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,660
你可能在想
You're probably thinking,

185
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,750
“什么 这太疯狂了”
"What? This is crazy.

186
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,500
“我要和我的敌人一起吃饭”
"I'm going to have dinner with the enemy?

187
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,250
“她做的通心粉还真好吃”
"And she made some really good smelling macaroni."

188
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,500
但是说实话 如果我想杀了你…
But in all honesty, if I wanted to kill you--

189
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,790
你早就动手了
You would have already.

190
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,160
就在你开门的瞬间
Right as you open the door.

191
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,290
- 我可能都没有关门的机会 - 绝对没有
- I probably wouldn't have time to shut it. - No.

192
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,000
- 我早就死了 - 对
- I'd have been dead. Okay. - No.

193
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,540
好吧
Yeah.

194
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,160
哪位 
Hello?

195
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,040
格尔斯 我是克林特 我能上来吗 
Hey, Grills, it's Clint. Can I come up?

196
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,540
天啊 当然 快上来
Oh, my God, yeah, yeah, come up.

197
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,080
我一直在想 给你的狗起个什么名字…
I've been thinkin' about a name--

198
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
你好
- Hey. - Oh.

199
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,660
我能进去吗 
Can I come in?

200
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,250
进来吧
Yeah, come on.

201
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,040
- 你不吃了吗  - 不吃了
- Are you done? - Yeah.

202
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,160
- 那我都吃了  - 没问题
- I go? - Sure, can.

203
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,540
我可以把热酱汁浇在上面吗 
- I could put hot sauce on it? - Hmm.

204
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,950
我最喜欢热酱汁了
Ah, I love hot sauce.

205
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,700
太棒了
Yes.

206
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,000
你到底想干什么 
So what do you want?

207
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,790
这是我第一次来纽约
Well, it's my first time in New York.

208
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,040
算是出差吧 所以时间很有限
It's a business trip, so time is limited.

209
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,540
但是我还是想到处看看
But I want to see some things.

210
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,040
我想去看看帝国大厦
I want to see, uh, the Empire State Building,

211
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,700
新修缮的自由女神 还有洛克菲勒中心
the new and improved Statue of Liberty, and the Rockefeller Center.

212
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,040
有意思
Very funny.

213
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,700
怎么了 那些地方不好吗 
What, it's not good?

214
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,540
不 那些地方挺好的
Oh. No, they're-they're great.

215
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,790
你一定得去看看那棵圣诞树
Yeah, you... I mean, you've gotta see the tree.

216
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,620
没错 知道吗  我最喜欢美国圣诞树了
Exactly. See? I love American Christmases.

217
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,000
圣诞树 礼物 还有超能力驯鹿 是叫鲁道夫吧
The tree, the presents, the super-powered reindeer, Rudolph.

218
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,870
- 是鲁道夫 - 它太神奇了
- Mmm-hmm. Rudolph. Heh. - He is so weird.

219
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,950
你吃过驯鹿吗 
Have you ever eaten reindeer?

220
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,410
- 我可没有那种愉悦的经历 - 那是…
- Cannot say I've had the pleasure. No. - It's...

221
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,450
那可一点都不愉悦
No, it is not a pleasure.

222
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,540
肉特别硬 很难嚼动
No, it's, um, it's really tough. It's chewy.

223
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,500
得炖好长时间
Mm, you have to braise it for a really long time.

224
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,540
但是 凯特·毕晓普 你是在这里长大的 对吗 
But, hey, Kate Bishop, you grew up here, right?

225
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,790
你肯定能给我些推荐吧
You must have some recommendations for me.

226
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,000
是的…
Yeah... Um...

227
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,330
可以的 我想想 高架公园 那里不错
Yeah, I-I have. Let's see. The High Line. High Line is great. Um...

228
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,080
联合广场有个圣诞集市
There's a Christmas market in Union Square. Um...

229
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,580
但是我不确定那些地方 适不适合嗜血杀手
I'm not quite sure those are the right fit for the blood-thirsty vigilante type.

230
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,750
嗜血杀手
Blood-thirsty vigilante.

231
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,450
你还真幽默 凯特·毕晓普
Sometimes you're funny, Kate Bishop.

232
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,950
你一直连名带姓地叫我 就是为了显摆你知道关于我的事吗 
Do you say my whole name to point out that you know it?

233
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,370
是的 我知道你很多事
Yes. I know a lot about you.

234
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,330
母亲是埃莉诺 住在公园大道和41街交叉口
Mother, Eleanor. Lives on Park and 41st.

235
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,700
父亲是德里克 去世了 我很抱歉
Father, Derek, deceased. Very sad.

236
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,700
你最近还冲进车流里救了一条狗
And you recently walked into traffic to save a dog,

237
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,000
我必须得说 干得漂亮
which I'll admit is pretty cool,

238
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,290
也让我对你多了点好感
and you got a few points from me on that. Um...

239
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,290
大学平均学分3.8 大四学生 双学位 还有…
University GPA 3.8. Senior, double major, and--

240
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,410
好了 行了 我知道了
Right, okay. We get it.

241
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

242
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,450
你来纽约是要找克林特交谈吗  你就是为了这个来这 
Are you in New York to talk to Clint? Is that why you're here?

243
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,750
不 当然不是
No. No, no, no.

244
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,540
我是来要他命的
I'm here to kill him.

245
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,250
我有个问题要问你
I have a question for you.

246
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,910
为什么 
What is it?

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,660
你为什么要为他 为克林特·巴顿卖命
Why do you risk your life for him, Clint Barton?

248
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,080
为什么大家会原谅他的过去 
How has everybody forgiven him for his past?

249
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,120
他拯救了世界
He saved the world.

250
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,410
不对 拯救世界的是我姐姐
No. My sister saved the world.

251
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,370
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫 是她拯救了世界
Natasha Romanoff, she saved the world.

252
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,120
别再假装镇定了 这一点都不酷
Stop pretending like you're not surprised. It does not look cool.

253
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,160
你真的是娜塔莎的妹妹 
You're really Natasha's sister?

254
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,330
是的
Yes.

255
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,370
这我还真没想到 幸亏我刚才没杀了你
Wow. I did not see that coming. Thank God, I didn't kill you up there.

256
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,080
你想杀我 
You kill me?

257
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,080
再说一遍 凯特·毕晓普 你还真幽默
Again, oh, Kate Bishop, you are so funny.

258
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,580
太搞笑了 这句是最搞笑的
That's hilarious. That one is the funniest.

259
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,450
娜塔莎和克林特是朋友 你为什么要追杀他 
Natasha and Clint were friends. Why are you after him?

260
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,870
你很喜欢他啊
You are so fond of him.

261
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,410
这说明你不了解他是什么样的人
It tells me you don't really know who he is.

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,700
他为了保护我挺身而出
He came out here to protect me.

263
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,250
你错了 他是来保护自己的名声的
No. He came here to protect his reputation.

264
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,830
你知道他杀了多少人吗 
Do you know how many people he killed?

265
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,410
他所到之处血流成河 都能绕地球一圈了
The trail of blood that follows him, it could wrap around the entire world.

266
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,410
好吧 你们俄国人说话真狠
Okay. Wow. That was very Russian.

267
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,620
但是他仍然是个复仇者
He's still an Avenger.

268
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
那个词到底有什么意义 
What does that word even mean? Huh?

269
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,250
居然能有这么大力量
That it holds so much power.

270
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,250
不管他做了什么 你都认为他是英雄 对吗 
You call him a hero no matter what he does?

271
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,040
意思就是当你选择用毕生精力 去帮助别人的时候
It means that when you choose to spend your life trying to help people,

272
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,620
就必定要做出一些牺牲
there are going to be things that you lose.

273
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,660
当你面对他面对的威胁时
When you face the kind of threats that he has,

274
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,450
也一样会伤及无辜
there's going to be collateral damage.

275
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,790
我姐姐就是因为他才死的
My sister is gone because of him.

276
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,000
什么 不 那是…不可能的
What? No. No, that is... No.

277
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,370
她死了
She's gone.

278
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,200
这也算是伤及无辜吗 
Is she collateral damage?

279
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,750
不可能 这绝对不可能是真的
No, look, there is no way that that is true.

280
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,540
他不会这么做的
He would not let that happen.

281
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,120
你认识克林特·巴顿多长时间了 
How long have you known Clint Barton?

282
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,080
大概一周
About a week.

283
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,790
完成这个任务对我而言并不困难
It will not be difficult for me to complete this assignment.

284
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,250
等等 有人雇佣你来杀他 
Wait a minute, somebody hired you to kill him?

285
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,660
我想说的是 如果有人和你说
All I'll say is that if there is someone out there

286
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,540
克林特是个坏人
that is telling you Clint is a bad guy,

287
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,910
那你应该问问你自己 雇佣你的人是什么样的人
then maybe you should ask yourself what kind of person hired you.

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,870
他并不完美 毕竟人无完人 但是他是个好人
He is not perfect. Nobody's perfect. But he is good.

289
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,080
我不知道他是怎么让你相信 他的为人的
However he convinced you about who he is

290
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,540
我也不管有多少人把他当作英雄
or how many people think or call him a hero,

291
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,000
其实这些都不重要
truth is it doesn't matter.

292
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,830
一个人的所作所为说明一切
We are defined by what we do.

293
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,910
说得再怎么天花乱坠也没用
Not by nice words.

294
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,160
不管你愿不愿意 他都别想跑
Like it or not, there is no escaping this.

295
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,950
所以…
So...

296
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,080
他在哪 
Where is he?

297
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,040
我不知道
I don't know.

298
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,450
好吧
Okay.

299
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,950
谢谢你陪了我一个晚上 我是真心的
Thank you for the girls' night, truly.

300
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,620
还有 凯特·毕晓普 别再妨碍我了
Oh. And, Kate Bishop, do not get in my way again.

301
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,700
非常感谢 谢谢你
Well, I really appreciate it, thank you.

302
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,660
不客气
No problem.

303
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,790
因为有…这个家伙
Since there was this... This guy.

304
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,540
哥们 当然没问题
Come on, man, of course.

305
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,950
你能帮我再照看几天狗吗 
You think you could, um, look after the dog just for a few more days?

306
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
当然可以
Sure.

307
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,660
我定了个酒店 他们没有…
I, I got a hotel, and they don't have--

308
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,370
- 他们不让带狗入住 - 等等
- They don't allow dogs. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

309
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,750
- 酒店  - 是啊 就是…
- Hotel? - Yeah, it's just, uh...

310
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,370
这可不行
No way.

311
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,750
鹰眼怎么能在酒店过圣诞节 
Hawkeye's gonna stay in a hotel for Christmas?

312
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,580
哥们 睡我的沙发吧 不 睡我的床吧
Man, take my couch. Really, take my bed.

313
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,580
沙发就很好了 谢谢你
The-The-The couch will be great, thank you.

314
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,750
来吧 哥们
Here, bud.

315
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,700
差点忘了
Almost forgot.

316
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,080
米茜把你和凯特的新衣服拿来了 要不要看看 
Missy dropped off the new outfits for you and Kate. You wanna see 'em?

317
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,950
我会看的 晚点再说吧
You know I do. Just... Just not right now.

318
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,040
我们需要你来回答一些问题
We're gonna need you to come in and answer some questions.

319
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,250
我向你保证 这是个天大的误会
I promise you this is all a big misunderstanding.

320
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,500
我这辈子从来都没有工作过
I've never worked a day in my life.

321
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,750
我们手上的税务记录可不是这么回事
We have some tax records that will beg to differ.

322
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,080
我告诉你 我唯一认识的斯隆
I'm telling you, the only Sloan I've ever known

323
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,830
就是在棕榈海滩约会的那个女的 她可差劲极了
was this woman I dated in Palm Beach and she was an absolute nightmare.

324
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,750
抱歉 妈妈
I'm so sorry, Mom.

325
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,700
我调查过了 亲爱的 你说的是对的
I looked into it, honey, and you were right.

326
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,620
我不怪你叫警察来
I don't blame you for calling the police.

327
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,000
换做是我 也会做同样的事
I would have done exactly the same thing.

328
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,290
很明显我是被陷害的
I've obviously been framed.

329
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,580
我会洗清罪名的
I'll clear all this up

330
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,830
我很快就回来参加圣诞聚会 等着瞧吧
and be back in a jiffy for your Christmas party, you'll see.

331
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,750

335
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,450
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫 克林特·巴顿

336
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,700
娜塔莎…
Natasha...

337
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,700
我现在真的想和你说说话
I really need to talk to you right now.

338
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,580
你是我们当中最英勇的 对吧 
You were the bravest of us all, weren't you?

339
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,950
忠心耿耿 固执己见
Loyal, stubborn.

340
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,370
你永远争强好胜 对吗 
You always had to win, didn't you?

341
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,120
就为了一块橙色的破石头
And for a stupid orange rock.

342
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,410
我在脑子里重演了无数遍 希望能有个不一样的结局
I replayed that a million times in my head hoping for a different outcome.

343
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,660
但是我每天都在努力 让你赋予我的生命不会虚度
But I do my best every day to earn what you gave me.

344
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,660
我只想说…
Just wanna say I'm...

345
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,120
我只想说 我很想念你
Just wanna say I miss you.

346
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,750
希望你能原谅我接下来的举动
And I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do.

347
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,540
你好 是我
Hey, it's me. Um...

348
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,500
听着 我知道你说过“结束了” 但是还没有结束
Listen, I know you said, "It's over," but it's not.

349
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,580
至少对我没有
Not for me.

350
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,700
给我回电话
Call me back.

351
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,040
咱们得谈谈屋顶上的另一个女人
We need to talk about the other woman on the roof.

352
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,330
不是玛雅 是另一个人
Not Maya, no, the other one.

353
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,660
电话里不能说太多 给我回电话
I don't wanna say much on the phone. Call me back.

354
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:38,330
警察逮捕了杰克 非常疯狂
So, the police arrested Jack, which is all pretty crazy.

355
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,500
我得给你讲讲
Would be great to discuss.

356
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,450
对 没错 我确实搞砸了几次
Yeah, okay, sure, I've screwed up a few times.

357
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,750
好吗 好吧 不管怎么说 我还在学呢
Okay? Fine, whatever, I'm still learning.

358
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,250
该死
Oh, shit.

359
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,200
你觉得我想这样吗 克林特 
Do you think I wanna do this, Clint?

360
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,950
你觉得我想像疯子一样 留这么多言吗 
You think I wanna leave these messages like a crazy person?

361
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,200
不 这都是你的错
No, this is your fault.

362
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,500
咱们没完 巴顿 我会找到你的
This isn't over, Barton. I'm gonna find you.

363
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,700
语音信箱已满 目前无法接收新消息
The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time.

364
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,370
- DMC的经典运动服 - 太经典了
- Run-DMC's classic tracksuit. - Classic. Classic.

365
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,830
还有奥运会上的汤米·史密斯
Or, uh, Tommie Smith in Olympics

366
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,330
还有《天才一族》对吗 
or Royal Tenenbaums, right?

367
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,200
还有托尼·瑟普拉诺的那句 “算了吧”
Tony Soprano, "Forget about it".

368
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,500
《天才一族》  得了吧 咱们哪里像天才了
Royal Tenenbaums? Come on. Do we look like Royal Tenenbaums?

369
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,330
挺像的
Yes.

370
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,120
- 你知道有什么好久没出现了吗  - 什么 
You know what you don't see anymore?

371
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,040
铜指虎
- Tell me. - Brass knuckles.

372
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,620
那玩意怎么用啊 
What are we gonna do, huh?

373
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,910
打到一半从兜里掏出来 
Pull them out of your pocket in middle of fight?

374
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,200
“不好意思 等我一下”
"Wait one second please.

375
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,580
“等我把这个铜指虎戴上 让你尝尝我的厉害”
"Let me put on brass knuckle to punch your face."

376
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,250
“玛雅 今晚在第一次 遇到浪人的地方等我”
"Maya, meet me tonight where you first met the Ronin.

377
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
“一个人来”
"Alone."

378
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,290
可我们不是玛雅啊
But we are not Maya.

379
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,620
你打的真是时候 我刚把奈特哄睡
Hey. Perfect timing. I just put Nate down to bed.

380
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,790
那就好 我有话跟你说
Yeah, good. We need to talk.

381
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,950
这种开场一般都没什么好事
Uh-oh, no fun conversation's ever started that way.

382
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,620
是的
Yeah.

383
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,160
抱歉 情况越来越严重了
Look, I... I'm sorry, this problem just keeps getting bigger.

384
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,290
这个玛雅不肯善罢甘休
This Maya is relentless.

385
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,830
她之前拿到了手表 而且还在调查咱们家
She's got her hands on the watch. She looked into our family.

386
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,080
有人雇佣了黑寡妇
Someone has hired a black widow.

387
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,250
我都不知道还会发生什么
And I... I don't wanna think about where this all goes.

388
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,160
克林特 我们都很小心 毕竟孩子和我都离得那么远
Clint, we've been so careful, really. I... I mean, the kids and I are so far away.

389
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,200
还不够远 想找总能找得到
It's not far enough. It's never far enough.

390
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,040
如果我今晚不能和他们做个了断
If I don't end this tonight, um,

391
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,290
那个大人物出手是早晚的事
it's just a matter of time before the big guy gets involved.

392
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,250
天啊 你确定吗 
Jesus. Are you sure?

393
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,410
我不确定 只是有种不祥的预感
Can't be sure. It's just a sinking feeling.

394
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,290
那就跟着感觉走吧
Then follow your gut.

395
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,080
怎么了 不想听这个 
What? It's not what you wanted to hear?

396
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,830
没有
Yeah, no.

397
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,200
听着 你不用打电话征求我的同意
Listen, you didn't call looking for permission

398
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,250
你也不需要我的允许
and you don't need it from me so...

399
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,790
我相信你的判断
I trust your judgement.

400
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,500
做你认为该做的事吧
You do what you have to do.

401
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
好的
Okay.

402
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,790
记住 我永远比任何人都理解你
And know that I'll always understand

403
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,330
我爱你
more than anybody else ever could.

404
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,160
我也爱你 去做个了断吧
I love you.

405
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
好吧 咱们谈谈
I love you. Go end this.

406
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,290
我想让你…
Okay, let's talk.

407
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,950
看见…我的脸
Aah!

408
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,000
要让我亲眼看着你杀了我吗 
I wanted you...

409
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,660
不是
No.

410
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,950
但是如果你或任何人 敢来找我和家人的麻烦

So...

433
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,410
你杀了他吗

434
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,160
他逃跑了

435

That's it? He got away.
